title: About
---

As someone with a keen interest in computers, I enjoy developing web applications with React, Next.js, and Firebase to solve real world problems.
I possess a natural aptitude for working with IT systems and technologies, which complements my skills in programming.

Beyond work I enjoy watching films and reading non-fiction books. Occasionally, I write blogs on random topics, sharing insights on my experiences and thoughts.
